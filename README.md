# Airplane Price Prediction: 
This analysis aims to predict flight prices given the various parameters. Data used for this analysis is taken from Kaggle. This will be a regression problem since the target or dependent variable is the price (continuous numeric value). 

# The steps followed are : 
a. Data Loading 
<br/>
b. Data Preprocessing 
<br/>
c. Feature Engineering
<br/>
d. Data Preparation 
<br/>
e. Modeling

# The models used are : 
a. RandomForestRegressor
<br/>
b. XGBRegressor
<br/>
c. KNeighborsRegressor
<br/>
d. DecisionTreeRegressor

# Error Measures : 
a. MAE: Mean Absolute Error 
<br/>
b. MSE: Mean Square Error 
<br/>
c. RMSE: Root Measure Error 

# Conclusion :
Although the accuracy between the training and the test are nearly aligned. Trying various hyper parameter tuning may have improved the performance of the model.
